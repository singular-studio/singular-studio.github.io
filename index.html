        <p class="content">After I have an idea of the direction you want to go, I will give you my expert opinion on what's possible and practical, or what's possible but impractical, or what's just plain impossible. My goal is to find a solution that is going to add the most amount of value to your business for the least amount of work. For every business there will be a solution that will work best, and it's important to come to an agreement about what that solution will be from the get go.</p>

        <h2>Mockups</h2>
        <p class="content">Once we've reached a consensus for what we want in the website, I will proceed to produce mockups. These will provide you with something concrete to give you a good idea of how the finished product will look. This is the best time to make any major changes. If everything looks good, I will proceed with development of the website.</p>

        <h2>Your Website</h2>
        <p class="content">You now have a complete website that will be visible to everyone in the world! At this point, minor changes can still be made, but major changes are often more difficult and can require starting from square one in many cases. But I'm confident this won't be an issue, as we will always strive to have a plan we can both be confident in, and always keep an open line of communication throughout the development process to ensure the final product is of the highest quality.</p>
